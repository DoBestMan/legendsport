█ PRINCIPLES                              █ Updated: Andrés García - 09/05/2019

    https://www.genbetadev.com/metodologias-de-programacion/doce-principios-de-diseno-que-todo-desarrollador-deberia-conocer

    ■ DRY -> DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF (DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF)
        Duplicate code is a bad signal, or at least a signal that
        can do better. Is that duplicate code is prone to generate
        mistakes and it is hard to keep.

        Extract the duplicate code to a function. If there is a change to be made
        It will be in one place and not throughout the source code.
    ···········································································

    ■ KISS -> KEEP IT SIMPLY STUPID (KEEP IT SIMPLY STUPID)
        The design of an application MUST be simple. MUST AVOID COMPLEXITY
        AS A GENERAL STANDARD, especially unnecessary complexity; as soon as
        simpler be better!
    ···········································································

    ■ SOLID (CLASSES)
        https://www.genbetadev.com/paradigmas-de-programacion/solid-cinco-principios-basicos-de-diseno-de-clases

        ■ SINGLE RESPONSABILITY
            Classes must have a simple and concrete purpose.

            Sometimes we are tempted to create a method that has nothing to do with it.
            with the class, simply because he uses it; then taking advantage
            That is there. AVOID IT!
        ·······································································

        ■ OPEN / CLOSED (OPEN / CLOSED)
            Create extensible classes without entering the source code to
            modify it

            That is, the design must be open to be able to extend but closed
            to be able to modify. Although said seems easy, the complicated thing is
            predict where it should be extended and that we don't have to modify it.

            Be very clear how the application will work, where you can
            extend and how classes will interact.
            The most common use of extension is through inheritance and re-implementation
            of methods.

            There is another alternative that consists of using methods that accept
            an interface so that we can execute any class that implements
            that interface

            In all cases, the behavior of the class changes without us having
            had to touch internal code.
        ·······································································

        ■ L-LISKOV SUBSTITUTION (LISKOV SUBSTITUTION)
            Create all derived classes so that they can also be treated as
            The base class itself.

            When creating derivative classes we must ensure that we do not re-implement
            methods that make the base class methods not work if you
            treat as an object of that base class.
        ·······································································

        ■ I-INTERFACE SEGREGATION (INTERFACE SEGREGATION)
            When interfaces are defined, they must be specific to one purpose.
            concrete

            Therefore, if we have to define a series of abstract methods that should
            use a class through interfaces, it is preferable to have many
            interfaces that define few methods that have an interface with many
            methods

            The purpose of this principle is to take advantage of interfaces in other classes.

            If we have an interface that compares and clones on the same interface, from
            more complicated way can be used in a class that should only
            compare or in another that you just need to clone.
        ·······································································

        ■ D-DEPENDENCY INVESTMENT (DEPENDENCY INVESTMENT)
            The objective of this principle is to decouple classes.

            In every design there must always be a coupling but it must be avoided
            as far as possible. A non-coupled system does nothing but a
            Highly coupled system is very difficult to maintain.

            The objective of this principle is the use of abstractions to achieve
            that a class interacts with other classes without knowing them directly.
            That is, higher level classes should not know the level classes
            lower.
            In other words, you should not know the details. There are different
            patterns such as dependency injection or service locator that we
            They allow you to reverse the control.
    ···········································································

    ■ YAGNI -> YOU AIN'T GONNA NEED IT (YOU DON'T NEED IT)
        If you are not sure of something it is because you do not need to implement it
    ···········································································

    ■ RULE OF THE BOY SCOUT
        Do as the Boy Scouts, who leave the field cleaner than when they arrived.

        The code can always improve. If we can, we must re-factor the code
        to leave it even cleaner and simpler than before.
    ···········································································

    ■ LAW OF DEMETER
        According to this principle, a unit should only have limited knowledge of
        other units, and only know those that are related.
        The unit should only talk with friends and never with strangers. Besides, the
        unit should only talk to immediate friends.

        Simplifying a lot, we have to try to avoid using methods of an object
        which has been returned by another method. In this case it is useful to follow the rule of
        Never use more than one point when accessing methods of an object.

        For example, do not use Current client.GetAddress.Call.Change StreetName.
        Remember, do not talk to strangers.
    ···········································································

    ■ THE HOLLYWOOD PRINCIPLE
        The Hollywood principle: "Don't call us, we'll call you."

        This principle is related to the dependency investment principle
        of SOLID.

        An example of the Hollywood principle is control investment (IoC), which
        makes a class get the references to objects it needs to
        function, through an external entity.
    ···········································································

    ■ THE OCKHAM POCKET KNIFE
        "All things being equal, the simplest explanation is usually the most
        probable"

        The application of this philosophical principle to software development would be
        similar to the following:

        Between two or more possible solution alternatives, the simplest, simplest
        or easy, is the one to choose.

        This principle can even be applied to find errors, where
        starting with the simplest or simplest can help you find it without much
        wear.

█ STYLE GUIDE - GENERAL                   █ Updated: Andrés García - 09/05/2019
    ···········································································
    ■ *GLOSSARY*
        ■ lowercase: Lowercase, no spaces
        ■ UPPER_CASE: Uppercase, separate words with _
        ■ camelCase: Lowercase, without spaces, separate words with first capital letter.
        ■ snake_case: Lowercase, without spaces, separate words with _
        ■ kebab-case: Lowercase, without spaces, separate words with -
        ■ StudlyCase: First letter of each word in uppercase, without spaces
    ···········································································

    ■ THE PRINCIPLES
        1st - The code must be written and seen as if it had been written by
        only one person; although multiple people have intervened.

        2nd - The code must be written in a way that guarantees: your understanding
        when reading it the first time and its maintenance in the future.
    ···········································································

    ■ TO BEGIN
        To a greater extent writing code must have the PSR standard as a primary basis
        for PHP Especially its PSR2 standard (https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2).

        This extends to other languages ​​with the exception of their own
        language peculiarities For example: HTML requires the use of quotation marks
        double, contrary to the recommendation of the standard that speaks of using quotation marks
        simple.
    ···········································································

    ■ GENERAL
        ■ Language: English
        ■ Writing mode: Lowercase, no special characters (tildes) or
            different from English
        ■ Ideation: 4 blank spaces
        ■ Length of lines: Up to 80 characters, although not strict and can
            Spread reasonably or completely ONLY IF IT IS NECESSARY,
            as are the urls.
    ···········································································

    ■ RELEVANCE ORDER
        The style guide may contradict the rules or standards.
        Therefore an order of relevance is established, indicating what can
        overwrite what.

        ■ 1st, the EXPRESS ORDERS
            You can overwrite everything from here down. And they are the ones that a person
            with authority or faculty within the project, determines to write code of
            somehow.

        ■ 2nd, the CONVENTIONS used
            They are the ones that must be followed because similar scripts are written
            So. This makes sense when you have doubts or there is no indication
            accurate.

        ■ 3rd, the SPECIFIC STYLE GUIDE (Project)
            It is the specific style guide of the project.

        ■ 4th, THE GENERAL STYLE OR COMPANY GUIDE
            It is this guide and should be followed and applied for all the projects of the
            business.

        ■ 5th, the STANDARDS applied
            These are the standards and good practices that must be followed and applied.
            as determined by the project in its documentation. Just as it does
            this guide.

        ■ 6th, THE LANGUAGE RULES
            They are the rules and good practices determined by language.
    ···········································································

    ■ STANDARDS
        ■ NAMES
            ■ SINGULAR / PLURAL
                The elements must be named in the singular when applied to it.
                If it applies to several it must be in the plural.

                BAD: topsPage -> Refers to several TOPS in it
                        PAGE (which is not possible)

                OK: pagesTop -> Refers to the TOP of several PAGES
            ···································································

            ■ GROUPING
                When there are elements that belong to a common context
                they must be grouped with prefixes; although it does not comply with English rules.

                This applies to: projects, directories, files, space
                names, variables, constants, functions, objects, classes,
                methods, properties, etc.

                BAD: topPage = 50px;
                        leftPage = 50px;
                        widthPage = 50px;

                OK: pageTop = 50px;
                        pageLeft = 50px;
                        pageWidth = 50px;
            ···································································

            ■ EXPLICIT
                The names must allow, when reading them, to identify the function
                the task, the objective or the content.

                BAD: pgT = 50px;

                OK: pageTop = 50px;
            ···································································

            ■ SIMPLIFICATION
                As much as possible, simplify the names. I searched
                synonyms; The limit is not to lose understanding and explicit.

                BAD: pgT = 50px;

                OK: pageTop = 50px;
            ···································································

            ■ DATABASE
                ■ snake_case

                BAD: Elimination Date
                        date Elimination
                        datedelete

                OK: removal_date
                        date_delete
                        deleted_at
            ···································································

            ■ IN DIRECTORIES AND FILES
                ■ snake_case

                BAD: Main Module
                OK: main_module
            ···································································

            ■ DEFINITIONS
                ■ Variables: camelCase
                ■ Constants: UPPER_CASE
                ■ Functions: camelCase
                ■ Classes: StudlyCase
                ■ Methods: camelCase

                ■ Grouping
                    when grouping elements you can set a prefix in mode
                    snake_case, followed by underscore _ and then the element in
                    its definition.

                    BAD: pagesmoduledocument
                        Pages_ModuleDocument

                    OK: pages_modDocument
                        pagesProperties_modDocument
                        pagesModuleDocument
        ·······································································

        ■ COMMENTS
            ■ Language: English
            ■ Writing mode: Normal, paragraphs with capital letter and simplified text

                BAD: // SECTION FOR THE LOCAL VARIABLES OF THE CHARACTERISTICS: MAIN

                OK: // Local variables: Main

            ■ Rules
                ■ If the comment applies to several lines of code, set comment
                multiple like this:

                    / **
                    * Commentary...
                    * Commentary...
                    * /

                ■ If the comment ONLY applies to the code line, set comment
                in the same line from character 100 like this:

                BAD: display: none; // Hide Html

                OK: float: left;                                                // Indispensable
        ·······································································

        ■ LEGIBILITY
            the code MUST be readable, a line of code must be understood with
            One reading

            Create blank lines to SEPARATE and GROUP the code that meets a
            Same task or objective.

            A goal when writing code is not to reduce lines of code,
            since code minification can accomplish this later. For him
            On the contrary, an important objective is the readability of the code and its
            future maintenance.

            BAD:
                    private $ userModPermissions;
                    public function __construct () {
                        $ this-> middleware ('auth');
                        $ this-> middleware (function ($ request, $ next) {
                            $ this-> userModPermissions = new stdClass ();
                            $ this-> userModPermissions-> access = auth ('users') -> user () -> permissions-> ahp_users ['access'];
                            $ this-> userModPermissions-> create = auth ('users') -> user () -> permissions-> ahp_users ['create'];
                            $ this-> userModPermissions-> edit = auth ('users') -> user () -> permissions-> ahp_users ['edit'];
                            $ this-> userModPermissions-> delete = auth ('users') -> user () -> permissions-> ahp_users ['delete'];
                            $ this-> userModPermissions-> print = auth ('users') -> user () -> permissions-> ahp_users ['print'];
                            return $ next ($ request);
                        });
                    }

            CORRECT:
                    private $ userModPermissions;

                    public function __construct ()
                    {
                        $ this-> middleware ('auth');

                        $ this-> middleware (function ($ request, $ next) {
                            $ this-> userModPermissions = new stdClass ();
                            $ this-> userModPermissions-> access = auth ('users') -> user () -> permissions-> ahp_users ['access'];
                            $ this-> userModPermissions-> create = auth ('users') -> user () -> permissions-> ahp_users ['create'];
                            $ this-> userModPermissions-> edit = auth ('users') -> user () -> permissions-> ahp_users ['edit'];
                            $ this-> userModPermissions-> delete = auth ('users') -> user () -> permissions-> ahp_users ['delete'];
                            $ this-> userModPermissions-> print = auth ('users') -> user () -> permissions-> ahp_users ['print'];

                            return $ next ($ request);
                        });
                    }
    ···········································································

    ■ HTML
        HTML files must be written and structured according to the way in
        that the user is expected to navigate, identifying relevant sections.
        Like: menu, buttons, panels, etc. Then you must enter them.

        As navigation can be subjective, it must be started from the corner
        upper left; continuing down or to the right according to the
        Expected navigation and relevance.

        ■ CONVENTIONS
            ■ *Frm
                Termination in 'Frm' indicates that it is a container type element,
                frame or frame.

            ■ Naming containers, row, cols who contain HTML elements
                The HTML elements from business logic, usually are inside the
                containers; is necessary to set a "inside" attribute to help to
                identify the HTML element inside there.

                This is helpful when you need expand and collapse the code.

                <div inside="pending-tab" class="col-2>
                    <button type="button"
                        class="btn tab"
                        :class="{ active: tournament.betting.pending.show }"
                        @click="pending"
                    >Pending</button>

                    <span class="separator">|</span>
                </div>
        ·······································································

        ■ ATTRIBUTES
            ■ ORDER:
                Set the order of attributes within an HTML element alphabetically:

                BAD:
                    <input type="text" id="name">

                    <input type="text"
                        id="name"
                        name="name"
                        class="form-control @yield('name_class_error')"
                        value="@yield('name_value')"
                        @yield('form_disabled')
                    >

                OK:

                It is set if the item needs it, especially when it is due

                ■ camelCase, preferably in the singular. Use plural if it is a
                shared class that represents several HTML elements in your
                set (buttons / buttons). And singular if it is a class, which
                although shared, it represents only one element.

                ■ If the item has NAME or ID the class must be named as
                same way as much as possible. However, it is allowed
                use the ID to style the element. In itself, if you have an ID it is not
                you need to create a class to establish your style rather
                Use the ID.
