█ DEFINITION                        █ Updated: Andrés García - [17/dec/2019]

    Legend Sports in a software project to create a sports betting web app for
    the U.S. market.

    ■ USERS
        It is the person who uses the app (APP) to place "some types" of bets
        for "some" sports; and it's "some" because the app doesn't allow all
        types of bets, or all types of sports.

        In order for a user to place a bet, the user must be registered and
        log in to the app. There, you will have to FILTER the tournament
        list to find the tournament of your interest and thus REGISTER by
        placing at least one bet if the user has sufficient money (BALANCE).
    ···········································································

    ■ TOURNAMENTS
        The tournament is a database record which, in addition to tournament
        information such as: the registration price (BUY-IN), the initial chips
        (CHIPS), etc. Group together one or more sports EVENTS, such as matches,
        containing the start date, Team A and Team B and other information.

        When a user registers for a tournament, at least with one bet, he/she is
        denounced from his BALANCE (and also records) the value of the tournament
        (BUY-IN) and the COMMISSION by the operator (app). Bets within the
        tournament are not placedwith money but with chips. And as each event in
        which it has been wagered ends, if the bet is in the user's favor, the
        chips bet plus the agreed winning are returned (when placing a bet, the
        likely win is shown). If the bet, on the other hand, is not in the user's
        favor, those chips are lost.

        Tournaments have a limit (minimum and maximum at the same time) of users
        to register (Heads-up (2), Single table (10) and Unlimited). When the limit
        is met, no more users can be registered; if the limit is not met the
        tournament is canceled, and the BUY-IN and COMMISSION are returned to the
        user. For unlimited users, no more users can be registered if the EVENT
        has started and TORNEO does not allow late registration.
    ···········································································

    ■ HOW TO WIN
        As each EVENT ends, it is determined who won or lost. And those who win,
        earn chips that add up to the available chips and chips wagered on events
        that aren't yet happening. This generates a RANKING that is a list of
        users and the tabs that have sorted from which the most tabs have the
        one that has the least. Users who no longer have tokens are discarded.

        All this information is changing at all times, from the results (API
        jsonodds.com) to the tabs won and the finished events. That being the
        case, ranking always varies in real time.

        The award is set when creating the tournament and is based on a table,
        although it can also be customized; and determines which RANKING positions
        receive prize money. Since the tournament also sets what the prize will
        look like. When all TORNEO EVENTS have ended, the award happens with
        return to BALANCE of the favored users.

        It must be said that while this is part of the logic of the application,
        there must be a dynamism in the user's interaction with the app and
        constant feedback such as:
            ■  Record, send emails and show notifications when making deposits,
            winning bets, winning in a tournament, among others.
