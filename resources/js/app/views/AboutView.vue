                    So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that while
                    earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to perceive that my own
                    individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two; that my free will
                    had received a mortal wound; and that another's mistake or misfortune might
                    plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in Providence; for its
                    even-handed equity never could have so gross an injustice. And yet still further
                    pondering—while I jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship, which
                    would threaten to jam him—still further pondering, I say, I saw that this
                    situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only,
                    in most cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a plurality
                    of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your apothecary by mistake
                    sends you poison in your pills, you die.

                    True, you may say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these and
                    the multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg's monkey-rope
                    heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding
                    overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I would, I only had the
                    management of one end of it.
